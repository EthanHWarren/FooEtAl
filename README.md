# FooEtAl
 This is a Python package for Foo physics operations.

 To install locally in developer mode, open a virtual environment and use "python setup.py develop" while in the directory containing setup.py. Then use "pip install -e ." to install.

 Included in the base directory is a CLI based program, FooCLI.py, which can be used to access the Foo Physics operations directly. Type "python FooCLI.py -h" in the same directory to see currently available operations.
